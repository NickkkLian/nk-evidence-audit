# nk-evidence-audit

An agent skill for [Claude Code](https://code.claude.com) and [OpenAI Codex](https://developers.openai.com/codex). Turn "done, fixed, tested" into evidence a second agent judges.

**What you get.** One real run of nk-evidence-audit 0.1.4, copied from the terminal on 2026-09-30:

```text
$ python3 scripts/evidence.py run --dir demo --label unit --claim "the check passes" -- python3 -c "print('3 passed')"
3 passed
[evidence] demo/20260930-230525-unit  exit=0  0.011s  stdout sha256 7b01e2c3e1d3
$ python3 scripts/evidence.py verify --dir demo
  ✔ 20260930-230525-unit  intact 
✔ 1 bundle, 0 not trustworthy
$ python3 scripts/evidence.py verify --dir no-such-folder
✘ no such evidence folder: no-such-folder (nothing was verified)
```

Part of [nickkk-skills](https://github.com/NickkkLian/nickkk-skills) — skills that stop an AI coding agent's
"done, tested, safe" from being taken on faith.

## Try it

Nothing is installed and nothing under `~/.claude` changes: clone, run the self-test, run the example.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NickkkLian/nk-evidence-audit && cd nk-evidence-audit
python3 scripts/evidence.py --selftest
python3 scripts/evidence.py run --dir demo --label unit --claim "the check passes" -- python3 -c "print('3 passed')"
python3 scripts/evidence.py verify --dir demo
python3 scripts/evidence.py verify --dir no-such-folder
```

The self-test prints:

```text
evidence.py selftest · 14/14 passed
```

The last command prints the block at the top of this page; its last line is the one below, and its exit code is 1 (non-zero on purpose: it found something).

```text
✘ no such evidence folder: no-such-folder (nothing was verified)
```

## What it does

- The not-evidence table (`references/not-evidence.md`) lists seventeen things that were once accepted as proof and were not. It is the part to read first.
- The auditor brief (`references/auditor-brief.md`) works as a subagent prompt: three verdicts, no fourth.
- `scripts/evidence.py run` captures a command's raw stdout/stderr/exit code with the cwd, git head, timestamps and hashes; `index` lists bundles; `verify` flags edited or incomplete ones, and fails on a folder with no bundles. It records and re-runs; it does not detect a hand-typed log by itself.

The full procedure, the boundaries and where the rules came from are in [SKILL.md](SKILL.md).

## How it works

1. Write the claim as one sentence that can be false: "the login button opens the modal on mobile", not "UI fixed".
2. Capture, do not transcribe. Run the proving command through the bundler so the raw output, exit code, working directory, git head and hashes are saved together.
3. Include the negative. One run that shows the check can fail (an input that must be rejected, a deliberately broken sample).
4. List what you did not test, in the report, before the verdict is asked for.
5. Hand over: the claim, the bundle directory (`evidence.py index --dir evidence` prints it), the screenshots, the untested list.

## Why it is built this way

**The idea.** A claim of completion is the thing under review, not evidence for itself. The person or agent who did the work hands over raw output plus the command that produced it; someone who did not do the work decides whether that output proves the sentence.

**Where it came from.** The role split came from a run of incidents where "tested" reports were accepted and later found to rest on a paraphrase, an empty dataset, a hand-typed log with impossible timestamps, or a sentinel whose alert nobody read for three days.

**Evidence.** What was broken on purpose to show that the self-tests can fail is under [Verify](#verify); what was run end to end, and in which agent, is under [Compatibility](#compatibility).

## Install

Pick one of four ways: three for Claude Code, one for OpenAI Codex. Skills load when a session starts, so open a **new** session after installing.

### 1 · Terminal, one command

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NickkkLian/nk-evidence-audit ~/.claude/skills/nk-evidence-audit
```

1. Run the command above (for one project only, clone into `.claude/skills/nk-evidence-audit` inside that project).
2. Start a new Claude Code session.
3. Check it loaded: type `/nk-evidence-audit` — it appears in the slash-command menu. Or just ask for the task; the skill triggers on its own.

### 2 · Claude Code in a terminal session (plugin)

The plugin route goes through the [nickkk-skills](https://github.com/NickkkLian/nickkk-skills) marketplace. Add it once; after that each skill is one command.

```
/plugin marketplace add NickkkLian/nickkk-skills
/plugin install nk-evidence-audit@nickkk-skills
```

1. In a Claude Code session, run the first line (once per machine).
2. Run the second line.
3. Start a new session (or run `/reload-plugins`). The skill shows up as `nk-evidence-audit:nk-evidence-audit`.

Without opening a session, the same two steps work from a shell: `claude plugin marketplace add NickkkLian/nickkk-skills` then `claude plugin install nk-evidence-audit@nickkk-skills`.

### 3 · Claude desktop app (Code tab)

**Add the marketplace first — Discover only searches marketplaces you have already added.**

<sub>Recorded on 2026-09-16, when the marketplace listed ten skills, all at version 0.1.0; it lists more now. The repository list in this recording shows the recorder's own repositories because a GitHub account is connected; yours will show yours. Type the full name as in step 4.</sub>

1. In the chat box, type `/plugin marketplace` and press Enter (or open **Settings → Customize → Plugins**). The **Plugins** panel opens.

6. Close the panel and start a new session.

To try it for one session without installing anything: `claude --plugin-dir ./nk-evidence-audit` from a clone.

### 4 · OpenAI Codex CLI

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NickkkLian/nk-evidence-audit.git ~/.agents/skills/nk-evidence-audit
```

1. Run the command above (for one project only, clone into `.agents/skills/nk-evidence-audit` inside that project).
2. Start a new Codex session.
3. Check it loaded, without spending a model call: `codex debug prompt-input | grep -o -- '- nk-evidence-audit[a-z0-9:-]*' | sort -u` prints `- nk-evidence-audit:nk-evidence-audit:`. Codex adds the `nk-evidence-audit:` prefix because this repository also carries a Claude Code plugin manifest. Ask for the task and the skill triggers on its own, or type `$` and pick it from the list.

## Compatibility

| Agent | Tested | What was checked |
|---|---|---|
| Claude Code (CLI 2.1.173, macOS) | yes | In a fresh project with an isolated Claude config, inside a macOS sandbox that blocked reading the tester's ~/.claude folder (settings, session history, memory), Desktop, Documents and Downloads, SSH keys and git identity, a plain request that never names the skill triggered it and it ran its bundled script. The route 2 plugin commands were also run from a shell with an isolated config: marketplace add, install, list. |
| OpenAI Codex CLI (0.154.0-alpha.6.2, gpt-5.6-sol, low reasoning, macOS) | yes | Copied into a fresh project's `.agents/skills`, without the user's Codex config. A plain request that never names the skill triggered it: Codex read SKILL.md, ran `scripts/evidence.py` for the claim and for a deliberately failing control, verified both bundles, and gave the verdict wording. |
| Cursor, Gemini CLI | no | Not tested. Their documentation says both read `~/.agents/skills`, the folder route 4 clones into; Gemini CLI asks before it activates a skill. |

Route 4 was checked for this repository: cloned from GitHub into a temporary home's `~/.agents/skills`, it was listed by the step 3 command. This skill's frontmatter uses only name, description, license and metadata.

## Verify

```bash
python3 scripts/evidence.py --selftest
```

Standard library only, Python 3.9+. On 2026-09-30 every self-test above passed, and
`breakcheck.py` from [nk-breakable-selftest](https://github.com/NickkkLian/nk-breakable-selftest) broke each script on purpose in a sandbox copy:

- `evidence.py`: 6 lines broken one at a time; each turned the self-test red without a traceback.

The unmutated control stayed green every time. Only lines that record a finding, raise, or return a failing exit code
were broken (the tool's pattern, or the hand-written list); a line number refers to the script as shipped in this version.
This shows those lines are covered. It does not show that nothing else can fail.

## Limits

- The bundler records what a command printed; it cannot tell whether the command was the right one.
- `verify` exits 1 on a folder that is missing or holds no bundle: nothing verified is not a pass (0.1.4; until 0.1.3 it printed a green "0 bundles").
- `verify` detects edited bundles, not staged ones — a claimer can run a different command. The auditor reads `command.txt` for that reason.
