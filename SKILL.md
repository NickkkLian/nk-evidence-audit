description: Turn "done, fixed, tested" into evidence a second agent judges. Use when you are about to report a task as complete, when an agent or teammate claims something works, or before acting on a "tests pass / 0 findings / all green" report. The claimer captures raw command output with a re-runnable command (scripts/evidence.py); an auditor who did not do the work reads only the evidence and returns one of three verdicts — supported, not supported, insufficient — never a fourth. Includes the table of things that look like evidence but are not.

# Evidence audit

**A claim of completion is the thing under review, not evidence for itself.** The person or agent who did
the work hands over raw output plus the command that produced it; someone who did not do the work decides
whether that output proves the sentence. Self-review confirms itself; that is why the two roles are separate.

> **Paths.** Commands in this skill start with `${…SKILL_DIR}`: this skill's own folder, the one that contains this SKILL.md. Claude Code fills it in. If your agent shows the placeholder as written (Codex, Cursor, Gemini CLI and others), replace it with that folder's absolute path before you run the command. Left as it is, it expands to nothing and the path breaks.

## When this applies

- You are about to write "fixed", "tested", "deployed", "verified", "clean" in a report.
- An agent, a subagent or a teammate reports one of those and someone will act on it.
- A green CI run, a passing self-test or a "0 findings" scan is being taken as the final word.

## Part 1 — if you are the claimer

1. **Write the claim as one sentence** that can be false: "the login button opens the modal on mobile",
   not "UI fixed".
2. **Capture, do not transcribe.** Run the proving command through the bundler so the raw output, exit code,
   working directory, git head and hashes are saved together:
   `python3 ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/evidence.py run --dir evidence --label login-modal --claim "login button opens the modal on mobile" -- <command>`
   Anything you would have to retype from a screen is not evidence yet. Web changes need a screenshot
   next to the bundle. Test data stays in place so the reviewer can look at it.
3. **Include the negative.** One run that shows the check can fail (an input that must be rejected, a
   deliberately broken sample). A checker nobody has watched fail proves nothing.
4. **List what you did not test**, in the report, before the verdict is asked for.
5. Hand over: the claim, the bundle directory (`evidence.py index --dir evidence` prints it), the
   screenshots, the untested list. Do not summarise the outputs in prose.

## Part 2 — if you are the auditor

Read `references/auditor-brief.md` (it doubles as a subagent prompt). The only question: **does this
evidence prove this sentence?** Three verdicts, no fourth:

| Verdict | Means | Must include |
|---|---|---|
| supported | the evidence directly proves the claim | which file, which line, supports which words of the claim |
| not supported | the evidence shows the claim false, or contradicts itself | the contradicting lines, quoted |
| insufficient | evidence missing, paraphrased, out of scope, or suspicious | what is missing and what would settle it |

Rules that keep the verdict honest:
- No evidence list from the claimer → `insufficient`. The burden is on the claimer; do not go and find it.
- "Looks fine", "probably ok", "common sense says" → `insufficient`, never `supported`.
- Output that is too clean (0 matches, all pass, one-second run for a five-second job, absurd numbers) →
  first suspect the tool that produced it; run `evidence.py verify` to see whether bundles were edited.
- Re-running a command is allowed as a check; say exactly what you re-ran.
- Audit only the sentence you were given; note anything else in one line.
- One line of verdict; expand only for `not supported` / `insufficient`: what is missing, what is
  suspicious, what would settle it.

## Part 3 — things that are not evidence

Full table in `references/not-evidence.md`. The ones met most often: a process is running ≠ it runs the
new code · exit 0 ≠ the command did the work (a search that quietly matched nothing) · `curl` works ≠ the
browser works · "push succeeded" ≠ live · same file count ≠ same content · documented ≠ current · self-check
green ≠ no holes (it only knows the failures someone wrote down) · passed on empty test data ≠ passes on
real data · an agent's "it works" ≠ its raw output · a paraphrase ≠ the output · test data deleted after
the run ≠ reviewable.

## Reporting findings (either role)

A finding carries three things or it is not finished: **where it was measured** (which files, which
scope), **how confident** (proven / supported but other causes not excluded / neither confirmed nor
refuted), and **the command that reproduces it**. "I could not prove it is wrong" is not "it is right".
Format in `references/finding-format.md`.

## Cost gate

Run the audit for claims someone will act on: shipped, fixed, migrated, cleaned, safe. Not for searches,
analyses, or reports that draw no conclusion. Every low-value audit weakens the ones that matter, and
an audit loop with no stop condition turns into building walls against an adversary who is not there —
decide up front who the auditor is protecting against (a colleague who makes mistakes, not a liar).

## Boundaries

- The bundler records what a command printed; it cannot tell whether the command was the right one.
- `verify` detects edited bundles, not staged ones — a claimer can run a different command. The auditor
  reads `command.txt` for that reason.

## Provenance

Own practice, 2026-07 to 2026-09. The role split came from a run of incidents where "tested" reports
were accepted and later found to rest on a paraphrase, an empty dataset, a hand-typed log with impossible
timestamps, or a sentinel whose alert nobody read for three days. The three-verdict rule and the
not-evidence table were written from those cases. No external source.
